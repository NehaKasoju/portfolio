                            Some of the most groundbreaking medical devices are changing lives, but only for people in
                            the right zip codes, the right hospitals, or the right healthcare systems. For millions of
                            patients in rural areas, low-resource communities, or smaller hospitals, life-saving
                            procedures are still out of reach.

                            This is a problem I care deeply about, not just as an engineer but as someone who has spent
                            years working on healthcare advocacy. For five years, I led a province-wide menstrual
                            hygiene fundraiser to help people access basic health products that should never be
                            considered a luxury. Advocacy is a core part of who I am. It is the reason I served as a
                            student trustee, and it is the reason I am now working in medical technology, focused on
                            surgical robotics and healthcare innovation.

                            But technology alone will not close the healthcare gap. We need to build for access, not
                            just advancement.

                            Let's take interventional procedures as an example. In the United States, a large portion of
                            needle-based procedures, such as biopsies, abscess drainages, and catheter placements,
                            require highly specialized clinicians, often interventional radiologists. The problem is,
                            80% of U.S. counties do not have access to interventional radiologists. That means many
                            patients cannot get the care they need close to home, or at all.

                            These are not luxury procedures. They are often critical for early cancer detection,
                            infection management, and life-saving interventions. Yet access is limited by geography,
                            specialist availability, and the complexity of the tools involved.

                            This is where medtech innovation has a new opportunity. We need to design intuitive, guided
                            devices that lower the skill barrier, allowing more clinicians, not just specialists, to
                            perform procedures with confidence and safety. This does not mean cutting corners on safety
                            or replacing expertise. It means supporting generalists, rural clinicians, and frontline
                            providers with the tools they need to deliver the same high-quality care found in urban
                            hospitals.

                            There are incredible technologies already on the market. Surgical robotics has redefined
                            what is possible in the operating room. The da Vinci Surgical System, for example, allows
                            for ultra-precise minimally invasive surgery, but at a cost of $1.5 to 2.5 million per
                            robot, plus $170,000 annually in maintenance fees and thousands more per case in disposable
                            instruments. It is an extraordinary system, but for many hospitals, the math simply does not
                            work. Similar cost barriers exist for imaging systems, where MRI machines can cost over $3
                            million, and even basic ultrasound guidance platforms can cost tens of thousands.

                            These technologies are not the problem. They are marvels of engineering. But if we want to
                            create healthcare systems that serve everyone, we need to complement these high-end
                            solutions with affordable, scalable tools that work in diverse clinical settings.

                            This is not just an engineering challenge. It is a healthcare equity challenge. It is about
                            building devices that are smaller, smarter, and easier to use while keeping costs
                            manageable. It is about thoughtful design, human-centred interfaces, and systems that
                            support clinicians wherever they are.

                            about pushing the boundaries of technology, but just as passionate about making sure those
                            boundaries do not leave people behind.

                            Healthcare is not just about having the newest device. It is about ensuring everyone can

                            As engineers, designers, and future healthcare leaders, we have a choice. We can build for
                            the few, or we can build for the many. Advocacy is not separate from engineering; it is part
                            of it. And if we do this right, the next wave of medtech will not just change how we treat
                            patients. It will change who gets treated, too.
