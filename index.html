                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">Innovation Is Not Enough, Healthcare Needs Access Too</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Healthcare is advancing at a breathtaking pace. We are living in an era where robotics, AI-guided procedures, and advanced imaging are transforming the way clinicians treat disease. But there is an uncomfortable truth we need to face: access to healthcare innovation is not evenly distributed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Some of the most groundbreaking medical devices are changing lives, but only for people in the right zip codes, the right hospitals, or the right healthcare systems. For millions of patients in rural areas, low-resource communities, or smaller hospitals, life-saving procedures are still out of reach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        This is a problem I care deeply about, not just as an engineer but as someone who has spent years working on healthcare advocacy. For five years, I led a province-wide menstrual hygiene fundraiser to help people access basic health products that should never be considered a luxury. Advocacy is a core part of who I am. It is the reason I served as a student trustee representing over 83,000 students, and it is the reason I am now working in medical technology, focused on surgical robotics and healthcare innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        But technology alone will not close the healthcare gap. We need to build for access, not just advancement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Let's take interventional procedures as an example. In the United States, a large portion of needle-based procedures, such as biopsies, abscess drainages, and catheter placements, require highly specialized clinicians, often interventional radiologists. The problem is, 80% of U.S. counties do not have access to interventional radiologists. That means many patients cannot get the care they need close to home, or at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        These are not luxury procedures. They are often critical for early cancer detection, infection management, and life-saving interventions. Yet access is limited by geography, specialist availability, and the complexity of the tools involved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        This is where medtech innovation has a new opportunity. We need to design intuitive, guided devices that lower the skill barrier so more clinicians, not just specialists, can safely perform procedures with confidence. This does not mean cutting corners on safety or replacing expertise. It means supporting generalists, rural clinicians, and frontline providers with the tools they need to offer the same quality of care found in urban hospitals.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        There are incredible technologies already on the market. Surgical robotics has redefined what is possible in the operating room. The da Vinci Surgical System, for example, allows for ultra-precise minimally invasive surgery, but at a cost of 1.5 to 2.5 million dollars per robot, plus 170,000 dollars annually in maintenance fees and thousands more per case in disposable instruments. It is an extraordinary system, but for many hospitals, the math simply does not work. Similar cost barriers exist for imaging systems, where MRI machines can cost over 3 million dollars, and even basic ultrasound guidance platforms can cost tens of thousands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        These technologies are not the problem. In fact, they are marvels of engineering. But if we want to create healthcare systems that serve everyone, we need to complement these high-end solutions with affordable, scalable tools that work in diverse clinical settings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        This is not just an engineering challenge. It is a healthcare equity challenge. It is about building devices that are smaller, smarter, and easier to use while keeping costs manageable. It is about thoughtful design, human-centred interfaces, and systems that support clinicians wherever they are.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Personally, this is the kind of medtech innovation I want to help build. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology, but just as passionate about making sure those boundaries do not leave people behind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Healthcare is not just about having the newest device. It is about ensuring everyone can benefit from the technology we create.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        As engineers, designers, and future healthcare leaders, we have a choice. We can build for the few, or we can build for the many. Advocacy is not separate from engineering; it is part of it. And if we do this right, the next wave of medtech will not just change how we treat patients. It will change who gets treated, too.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">My First Year in Waterloo Mechatronics</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Hi, I'm Neha, a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I just wrapped up my first year and wanted to share what it was like. I remember doing hours of research, endless thinking, and countless coffee chats before choosing this program. So if you're reading this hoping to find some clarity, I hope it helps.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Settling In</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        When I moved into UWP's Eby Hall, I was equal parts excited and nervous, ready to live alone for the first time, meet classmates, and learn.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        During those early weeks, I'd wake up early to explore. I found trails, study spots, and wandered uptown Waterloo.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Finding Community</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Waterloo Engineering runs on a cohort system, which means you're with the same group of students for five years. Naturally, community matters ‚Ä¶a lot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Luckily, my class (Mechatronics 2029, Stream 8) was full of kind, curious, and driven people. Everyone I spoke to had something unique to share. Within the first week, I already felt like I belonged.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Getting Involved</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        In Week 1, I joined Watonomous, an autonomous vehicle design team. I worked under the vehicle platform division and immediately met students who were not only skilled but also incredibly willing to mentor and share knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        I also found community through Socratica's coworking sessions and the Engineering Society (EngSoc). These spaces were full of thoughtful, driven, and passionate people. Being around them helped me feel inspired and connected. If you're looking to find your crowd, take action. Join a club, show up to something, say hi. You never know where it'll lead.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        And if you want something to exist, don't be afraid to take the lead and make it happen. Since the first week of school, I'd ask new friends, some I had just met, if they wanted to join me on my early 6 AM walks. To my surprise, a few did. I organized a girls' baking night to help build connection among the women in my class. None of it was fancy; it was just small moments of initiative that created space for the community to grow. Building community doesn't always require something big. Sometimes it's just about being the person who invites, who shows up, and who cares.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Courses in 1A included: CHE 102, MATH 115, MATH 116, MTE 100, MTE 121
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        A highlight was building a Braille printer using a LEGO EV3 robot in MTE 100.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Most professors were genuinely supportive. But as finals approached, it was clear many of us were struggling with CHE 102. Wanting to help, I reached out to another chemistry professor, and we held a three-hour crash course that covered the entire course. It made a big difference for a lot of us. If you notice something's missing, the best thing you can do is take initiative. Not just for yourself, but for those around you.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Studying & Finals</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Studying for finals was a learning curve. What worked for me was starting with a bit of theory and then diving right into practice. With repetition, concepts started to stick far better than they did through memorization alone. Don't be afraid to experiment with your study style.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">The 1B Shift</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Heading into 1B, the coursework got deeper, and job searching was added to the mix.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        This term, I made more time for joy: walks, gym sessions, dinners with friends, and side quests. These moments made all the difference.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Courses in 1B: MATH 118, MTE 111, MTE 119, MTE 120, MTE 140
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        MTE 120 (Circuits) was my favourite. I've found that mindset matters more than most people think. Tell yourself you want to be there, and the experience changes.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">A Few Gentle Reminders</h4>
                    <ul class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>You're not alone. Your entire class is going through the same thing.</li>
                        <li>You chose to be here. Remind yourself why.</li>
                        <li>Breaks are essential.</li>
                        <li>Yes, the schedules are busy. Living alone offers freedom, but also demands accountability. You have to make yourself show up to class, to deadlines, to yourself.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        Looking back, I'm proud of how much I've grown. I've gained knowledge in systems, circuits, and CAD. But more importantly, I've learned more about myself.
